    "summary": {
      "body": "My career has always centered on building systems that help people work with clarity. I’ve led teams, shaped large-scale operations, created workflow automations, and developed internal tools and software platforms — all guided by a calm, adaptive approach to complexity and a strong belief that systems should support people, not the other way around."
    },
    "story": [
      "My career began in environments where clarity and structure were essential to keeping daily operations running. In custodial and facilities management roles across multiple university campuses, I supervised large teams, coordinated coverage across high-variance spaces, and maintained productivity levels significantly above industry benchmarks. Over time, I became responsible for the operational systems beneath the work — CMMS workflows, payroll and HR processes, accounts receivable, transportation coordination, and other information flows that kept teams moving. These roles gave me a deep understanding of how performance depends on workflow design, clear expectations, and the systems people rely on every day.",
      "That instinct to strengthen and clarify systems eventually led me toward building tools myself — first through workflow automations and internal reporting scripts, and later through full-stack application development. I’ve since designed budgeting tools, workflow systems, developer environments like Dev Toolbox, and conceptual models for conversational software through Aurora. What looks like a career shift is really a continuation of the same work: understanding how people interact with systems, and creating structures that make that interaction calmer, clearer, and more aligned with real-world needs."

    "howIWork": [
      "As I moved from operations into software, I carried the same commitment to clarity and structure. I build in a clarity-first way — starting with briefs, system outlines, and narrative framing before implementation — so the work stays intentional and aligned across the entire project."

    "auroraOriginSafe": [
      "Aurora began as a series of questions about clarity, communication, and the gap between how people think and how software expects us to think.",
      "It grew from the idea that software creation could feel more conversational, more explainable, and more aligned with natural human reasoning — without exposing technical internals or implementation details."

      "I enjoy designing systems in any context — work, tools, writing, or personal organization.",
      "I gravitate toward environments where clarity and purpose matter, and where thoughtful design makes work feel lighter for everyone involved."
