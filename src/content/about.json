      "body": "My career has moved through several domains: operations, leadership, business systems, and software development. I\u2019ve supervised teams, coached and developed people, handled complex workflows, and created tools to help work happen with more clarity and less friction."
    },
    "story": [
      "I began in hands-on operational roles where clarity and structure were essential. Managing people taught me how systems break down at the human level: misaligned expectations, unclear responsibilities, and missing feedback loops.",
      "Later, I started developing software independently. Without a team to divide responsibilities, I had to design architecture, implement features, manage complexity, and refine systems on my own. This taught me to approach problems holistically \u2014 carrying both the technical and operational perspectives simultaneously.",
      "Today, I rely on both sides of that background. I build systems that help people do meaningful work with clarity and confidence."

    "auroraOriginSafe": [

      "I appreciate environments where clarity and purpose matter, and where thoughtful design makes work feel lighter."
