      "body": "My career has always centered on building systems that help people work with clarity. I’ve led teams, shaped large-scale operations, created workflow automations, and developed internal tools and software platforms — all guided by a calm, adaptive approach to complexity and a strong belief that systems should support people, not the other way around."
    },
    "story": [
      "I began my career in environments where clarity and structure weren’t abstract ideals — they were essential to keeping daily operations running. In custodial and facilities management roles across multiple university campuses, I supervised teams responsible for more than 450,000 cleanable square feet. I led 40 student housekeepers, coached full-time custodial staff, coordinated coverage across buildings with constantly shifting needs, and maintained performance levels of 43,000 square feet per FTE — significantly above industry benchmarks. I implemented the ISSA CIMS program and earned full certification with honors, redesigned routes and routines, and created communication loops that made work more predictable. These years taught me how deeply performance depends on workflow design, clear expectations, and the systems people rely on every day.",
      "As my roles expanded into office management and transportation coordination, I became responsible for the systems beneath daily operations: CMMS workflows, payroll and HR systems, accounts payable and receivable, and scheduling campus-wide transportation for athletic teams, student groups, and departmental travel. I managed driver pools, vehicle registration, approvals, and billing. During this time, I also built early automation tools using Google Apps Script to improve reporting accuracy, streamline communication, and reduce administrative friction. These experiences made the operational “hidden layer” visible — the information flows, routines, and dependencies that determine whether a team can move smoothly through their work.",
      "Over time, the instinct to improve systems — not just operate within them — led me into building internal tools and eventually into software development itself. I created budgeting tools, workflow systems, developer environments like Dev Toolbox, and conceptual models for conversational software through Aurora. Each step moved my work from managing systems to creating the systems themselves, blending the relational insight I developed in operations with the precision and structure of software.",
      "Today, I draw from both sides of my background — the practical realism of operations and the creative precision of software — to build tools and platforms that help people work with clarity, confidence, and less friction. The arc may look nonlinear on the surface, but the throughline is consistent: I’ve always worked on systems, whether physical, operational, digital, or conceptual. What ties it all together is a steady instinct to understand people, adapt to what the work requires, and restore clarity wherever things drift out of alignment."

      "Aurora began as a series of questions about clarity, communication, and the gap between how people think and how software expects us to think.",
      "It grew from the idea that software creation could feel more conversational, more explainable, and more aligned with natural human reasoning — without exposing technical internals or implementation details."
