"story": [
  "My career began in environments where clarity and structure were essential to keeping daily operations running. In custodial and facilities management roles across multiple university campuses, I supervised large teams, coordinated coverage across high-variance spaces, and maintained productivity levels significantly above industry benchmarks. Over time, I became responsible for the operational systems beneath the work — CMMS workflows, payroll and HR processes, accounts receivable, transportation coordination, and other information flows that kept teams moving. These roles gave me a deep understanding of how performance depends on workflow design, clear expectations, and the systems people rely on every day.",
  
  "That instinct to strengthen and clarify systems eventually led me toward building tools myself — first through workflow automations and internal reporting scripts, and later through full-stack application development. I’ve since designed budgeting tools, workflow systems, developer environments like Dev Toolbox, and conceptual models for conversational software through Aurora. What looks like a career shift is really a continuation of the same work: understanding how people interact with systems, and creating structures that make that interaction calmer, clearer, and more aligned with real-world needs."

  "As I moved from operations into software, I carried the same commitment to clarity and structure. I build in a clarity-first way — starting with briefs, system outlines, and narrative framing before implementation — so the work stays intentional and aligned across the entire project."
