    "title": "Dev Toolbox",
    "summary": "A mobile-first, self-hosted developer environment built to make real software development possible on the go — with context, planning, editing, and reasoning all in one place.",
    "role": "Independent designer and developer",
    "timeline": "2022–Present",
    "tags": ["Internal tools", "Developer experience", "Full-stack"],
    "problem": "There are very few good coding environments for mobile. And I kept exceeding the limits of the free-tier plan on Replit.",
    "context": "Dev Toolbox started as a response to a simple frustration: coding on the go just wasn’t feasible. I wanted something that would let me work wherever I was — with real context, real tools, and a workflow that didn’t fall apart outside a desktop setup, and didn't charge me monthly.",
    "solution": "I designed and built a self-hosted, mobile-first environment centered on the essentials: a clean file editor, integrated logging, and an innovative block selector for working with code blocks. Over time it expanded with GitHub and Trello integration, project planning tools, and an AI context packet downloader — all unified into a single workspace that keeps reasoning close at hand.",
    "innovations": [
      "Mobile-optimized code block selector for navigating and manipulating structured code",
      "Integrated, always-visible structured logs and console output",
      "Self-hosted GitHub integration for commits, diffs, and repository insights",
      "Unified project planner with sprints, sessions, and context surfaces",
      "AI context packet downloader for explainable, project-aware reasoning"
    ],
    "impact": "By bringing editing, planning, logs, GitHub, and project context together in one place, Dev Toolbox makes mobile development not just possible but productive. It reduces cognitive load, removes tool switching, and makes the entire workflow more structured, explainable, and portable.",
