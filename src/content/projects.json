    "title": "Dev Toolbox",
    "summary": "A mobile-first, self-hosted developer environment built to make real software development possible on the go — with context, planning, editing, and reasoning all in one place.",
    "role": "Independent designer and developer",
    "timeline": "2022–Present",
    "tags": ["Internal tools", "Developer experience", "Full-stack"],
    "problem": "There were very few reliable ways to develop software on mobile, and existing tools made the workflow feel fragmented, unpredictable, and detached from real project context. I wanted something calmer, clearer, and closer to the way I actually think.",
    "context": "Dev Toolbox began as a response to friction I felt personally: coding on the go wasn't feasible, and switching tools constantly created cognitive drift. My strengths in systems thinking and restorative problem-solving pushed me toward a unified workspace — something self-hosted, adaptable, and designed so that reasoning stayed visible rather than buried.",
    "solution": "I designed and built a self-hosted, mobile-first environment centered on the essentials: a clean file editor, integrated logging, and an innovative block selector for navigating structured code. Over time it evolved — guided by real usage, adaptability, and my instinct to reduce friction — gaining GitHub and Trello integration, project planning tools, and an AI context packet downloader that keeps reasoning close to the work.",
    "innovations": [
      "Mobile-optimized code block selector for navigating and manipulating structured code",
      "Integrated, always-visible structured logs and console output for continuous clarity",
      "Self-hosted GitHub integration for commits, diffs, and repository insights",
      "Unified project planner with sprints, sessions, and context surfaces",
      "AI context packet downloader for explainable, project-aware reasoning"
    ],
    "impact": "By bringing editing, planning, logs, GitHub, and project context into one coherent environment, Dev Toolbox reduces cognitive load and restores flow to mobile development. It makes the workflow calmer, more predictable, and easier to understand — aligning with how people naturally reason about their work.",

    "tags": ["Operations", "Workflow design", "Leadership", "Systems thinking"],
    "problem": "Teams were operating in high-variance environments with unclear expectations, gaps in communication, and workflows that generated unnecessary friction, rework, and unpredictability. People felt the strain — and the systems beneath the work weren't supporting them.",
    "context": "In my operations and leadership roles across higher-education facilities and campus services, I was responsible not just for outputs, but for the human and structural factors driving them. My strengths in empathy, connectedness, and restorative thinking consistently pulled me toward diagnosing patterns, clarifying expectations, and reshaping workflows so teams could perform with more confidence and less stress.",
    "solution": "I redesigned workflows, clarified expectations, introduced stable routines, and built early automation tools to increase visibility. This included Google Apps Script integrations for schedules and reporting, structured communication loops that kept teams aligned, and responsibility frameworks that made ownership clear at every level. Each change aimed to restore clarity and make day-to-day work feel calmer and more predictable.",

    "impact": "Teams experienced smoother handoffs, fewer surprises, and clearer expectations. Communication stabilized, responsibilities became visible, and day-to-day work became more predictable and calm. These years formed the foundation of my systems thinking — and established the strengths I now bring into internal tools, workflows, and software design.",

    "context": "Simplicity was built to support real financial behavior: recurring bills, flexible spending, shifting obligations, and daily decisions. My adaptive approach to systems and focus on reducing cognitive load shaped the entire flow — designed to meet people where they are, not force them into a rigid model.",
    "solution": "I created a calm, mobile-first budgeting environment that highlights what matters: upcoming obligations, category health, patterns, and day-to-day occurrences. The flow stays honest, predictable, and easy to revisit — bringing clarity back to areas of life that easily become overwhelming.",

    "problem": "Software creation today is fragmented across documents, tools, and communication channels, making it difficult to maintain clarity, shared understanding, and a coherent path from intention to result.",
    "context": "Aurora emerged from years of operational work and independent software development, shaped by questions around clarity, communication, and how people naturally express intent. My connectedness and restorative instincts made the friction especially visible — systems drifted, reasoning wasn’t transparent, and meaning often became diluted across layers.",
    "solution": "Aurora explores a conversational workflow where people express what they want, the system reflects its understanding, and results evolve through shared reasoning. This mirrors how people naturally collaborate — through dialogue, refinement, and relational clarity — without revealing any internal mechanisms or technical structures.",
