      "tags": ["Internal tools", "Developer experience", "Full-stack"],

      "ownership": "I owned problem framing, prioritization, and delivery decisions end-to-end, iterating the product through sustained real-world daily use.",
      "successCriteria": "Success meant making mobile development reliable: preserving context across sessions, making system behavior observable, and reducing cognitive switching while shipping real work.",

      "problem": "Mobile software development was fragmented and unreliable. Existing tools buried context, obscured system behavior, and made it difficult to resume work without losing reasoning or intent. Feedback existed, but it was scattered and disconnected from decision-making.",
      "context": "Dev Toolbox began as a response to friction I experienced personally. My systems-thinking and restorative instincts pushed me toward a unified workspace — one where planning, execution, logs, and reasoning stayed connected so learning could feed directly back into the work.",
      "solution": "I designed and built a self-hosted, mobile-first developer environment that treats feedback and context as first-class system properties. The platform evolved through real daily use to support planning, version control, structured logs, and explainable reasoning — keeping intent, behavior, and outcome aligned.",

      "impact": "Dev Toolbox made sustained mobile development practical by restoring predictable feedback loops and preserving reasoning across sessions. Work became easier to resume, decisions more traceable, and iteration safer — reducing drift between intent and implementation.",
