    "title": "Dev Toolbox",
    "summary": "A mobile-first, self-hosted developer environment built to make real software development possible on the go — with context, planning, editing, and reasoning all in one place.",
    "role": "Independent designer and developer",
    "timeline": "2022–Present",
    "tags": ["Internal tools", "Developer experience", "Full-stack"],
    "problem": "There were very few reliable ways to develop software on mobile, and existing tools made the workflow feel fragmented, unpredictable, and detached from real project context. I wanted something calmer, clearer, and closer to the way I actually think.",
    "context": "Dev Toolbox began as a response to friction I felt personally: coding on the go wasn't feasible, and switching tools constantly created cognitive drift. My strengths in systems thinking and restorative problem-solving pushed me toward a unified workspace — something self-hosted, adaptable, and designed so that reasoning stayed visible rather than buried.",
    "solution": "I designed and built a self-hosted, mobile-first environment centered on the essentials: a clean file editor, integrated logging, and a mobile-optimized block selector for navigating structured code. Over time — guided by real usage and the goal of reducing friction — it evolved to include GitHub and Trello integration, a structured project planner, and an AI context packet downloader.",
    "innovations": [
      "Mobile-optimized code block selector for navigating and manipulating structured code",
      "Integrated, always-visible structured logs and console output",
      "Self-hosted GitHub integration for commits, diffs, and repository insights",
      "Unified project planner with sprints, sessions, and context surfaces",
      "AI context packet downloader for explainable, project-aware reasoning"
    ],
    "impact": "By bringing editing, planning, logs, GitHub, and context into one coherent environment, Dev Toolbox reduces cognitive load and restores flow to mobile development. It makes the workflow calmer, more predictable, and more aligned with how people reason about their work.",

    "timeline": "2000–2016 (various roles)",
    "tags": ["Operations", "Workflow design", "Leadership", "Systems thinking"],
    "problem": "Teams were operating across large, distributed campus environments with inconsistent routines, unclear expectations, and communication gaps that led to rework, delays, and unpredictable outcomes. Coverage patterns shifted daily, student labor varied across semesters, and no underlying system supported consistency or clarity.",
    "context": "Across my roles in higher-education facilities, I supervised teams responsible for more than 450,000 cleanable square feet. I led 40 student housekeepers, coached full-time custodial staff, managed CMMS workflows, coordinated large event and summer conference schedules, and integrated HR, payroll, and transportation systems into daily operations. My strengths in empathy, connectedness, and restorative thinking consistently pulled me toward diagnosing workflow drift and redesigning underlying routines so teams could perform with clarity and confidence.",
    "solution": "I redesigned workflows, clarified expectations, introduced stable routines, and built automation tools to increase visibility. This included implementing ISSA’s CIMS program (earning certification with honors), designing route structures and coverage plans, strengthening communication loops between shifts, and creating reporting automations with Google Apps Script. These systems made work more predictable, clarified ownership, and reduced the friction teams encountered day to day.",

      "Performance systems that enabled teams to consistently operate at 43,000 square feet per FTE"
    ],
    "impact": "Teams experienced smoother handoffs, clearer responsibilities, higher standards, and more predictable days. Communication stabilized, rework decreased, and the department achieved full CIMS certification with honors while operating significantly above industry productivity benchmarks. These roles formed the foundation of my systems thinking — blending leadership, human behavior, operational structure, and clarity long before I began building software.",

    "problem": "Most budgeting tools generate noise instead of clarity. They surface too much, too little, or the wrong information at the wrong moment — creating stress rather than restoring confidence.",
    "context": "Simplicity was built to support real financial behavior: recurring bills, flexible spending, shifting obligations, and daily decisions. My adaptive approach to systems and focus on reducing cognitive load shaped the entire flow — designed to meet people where they are, not force them into a rigid model.",
    "solution": "I created a calm, mobile-first budgeting environment that highlights what matters: upcoming obligations, category health, patterns, and day-to-day occurrences. The flow stays honest, predictable, and easy to revisit — bringing clarity back to areas of life that easily become overwhelming.",

    "tags": ["Conceptual", "Systems thinking", "Human–AI collaboration"],
    "problem": "Software creation today is fragmented across documents, tools, and communication channels, making it difficult to maintain clarity, shared understanding, and a coherent path from intention to result.",
    "context": "Aurora emerged from years of operational work and independent software development, shaped by questions around clarity, communication, and how people naturally express intent. My connectedness and restorative instincts made the friction especially visible — systems drifted, reasoning wasn’t transparent, and meaning often became diluted across layers.",
    "solution": "Aurora explores a conversational workflow where people express what they want, the system reflects its understanding, and results evolve through shared reasoning. This mirrors how people naturally collaborate — through dialogue, refinement, and relational clarity — without revealing any internal mechanisms or technical structures.",
    "innovations": [
      "A conceptual approach to software shaped through conversation instead of traditional development steps",
      "A workflow centered on intent → understanding → result, emphasizing clarity and shared reasoning",
