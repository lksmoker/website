      "title": "Dev Toolbox",
      "summary": "A mobile-first, self-hosted developer environment designed to keep context, reasoning, and feedback visible — enabling real software development on the go without cognitive drift.",
      "role": "Independent designer and developer",
      "timeline": "2022–Present",
      "tags": ["Internal tools", "Developer experience", "Full-stack"],
      "problem": "Mobile software development was fragmented and unreliable. Existing tools buried context, obscured system behavior, and made it difficult to resume work without losing reasoning or intent. Feedback existed, but it was scattered and disconnected from decision-making.",
      "context": "Dev Toolbox began as a response to friction I experienced personally. My systems-thinking and restorative instincts pushed me toward a unified workspace — one where planning, execution, logs, and reasoning stayed connected so learning could feed directly back into the work.",
      "solution": "I designed and built a self-hosted, mobile-first developer environment that treats feedback and context as first-class system properties. The platform evolved through real daily use to support planning, version control, structured logs, and explainable reasoning — keeping intent, behavior, and outcome aligned.",
      "keyDecisions": [
        "Optimized for mobile-first development rather than desktop parity",
        "Consolidated editing, planning, logs, and context to reduce cognitive switching",
        "Favored structured workflows (sessions, sprints, work items) over ad-hoc flexibility",
        "Chose a self-hosted architecture to preserve control, extensibility, and data ownership",
        "Validated decisions through sustained personal use rather than speculative feature planning"
      ],
      "impact": "Dev Toolbox made sustained mobile development practical by restoring predictable feedback loops and preserving reasoning across sessions. Work became easier to resume, decisions more traceable, and iteration safer — reducing drift between intent and implementation.",
      "tradeoffs": [
        "Prioritized mobile-first predictability over full desktop feature parity",
        "Deferred multi-user collaboration to strengthen core planning and feedback workflows",

      "tags": ["Personal finance", "Product design", "Full-stack"],
      "problem": "Most budgeting tools overwhelm users with dashboards and alerts while failing to support real financial behavior. Feedback is either too noisy or too late, making it difficult to understand what actually needs attention.",
      "context": "Simplicity was shaped by an adaptive systems mindset: meet people where they are, reduce cognitive load, and make financial state understandable at a glance. The goal was not exhaustive reporting, but honest, actionable feedback.",
      "solution": "I designed and built a mobile-first budgeting system focused on clarity and revisability. The product highlights upcoming obligations, category health, and headroom — allowing users to orient quickly, adjust plans, and learn from patterns over time.",
      "keyDecisions": [
        "Prioritized signal over comprehensive dashboards",
