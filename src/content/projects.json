    "summary": "A mobile-first, self-hosted developer environment built to make real software development possible on the go — with context, planning, editing, and reasoning all in one place.",
    "role": "Independent designer and developer",
    "timeline": "2022–Present",
    "tags": ["Internal tools", "Developer experience", "Full-stack"],
    "problem": "There were very few reliable ways to develop software on mobile, and existing tools made the workflow feel fragmented, unpredictable, and detached from real project context. I wanted something calmer, clearer, and closer to the way I actually think.",
    "context": "Dev Toolbox began as a response to friction I felt personally: coding on the go wasn't feasible, and switching tools constantly created cognitive drift. My strengths in systems thinking and restorative problem-solving pushed me toward a unified workspace — something self-hosted, adaptable, and designed so that reasoning stayed visible rather than buried.",
    "solution": "I designed and built a self-hosted, mobile-first developer environment focused on reducing context switching and preserving clarity. Starting with core essentials — editing, logs, and navigation — the system evolved through real usage to support planning, version control, and explainable reasoning.",
    "keyDecisions": [
      "Optimized for mobile-first development instead of desktop parity",
      "Consolidated editing, planning, logs, and context to reduce cognitive switching",
      "Favored structured workflows (sessions, sprints, work items) over ad-hoc flexibility",
      "Chose a self-hosted architecture to preserve control, extensibility, and data ownership"
    ],

    "impact": "Dev Toolbox made sustained mobile development practical by reducing cognitive load and restoring predictable, focused workflows aligned with how developers reason about their work.",
    
    "tradeoffs": [
    "Dev Toolbox intentionally prioritizes mobile-first workflows rather than full desktop parity. This meant leaving out some advanced editing and visualization features in favor of predictability, low cognitive load, and real usability on smaller screens.",
    "The system was designed primarily for solo and small-team use. Multi-user collaboration features were deferred in favor of strengthening core planning, session logging, and context preservation workflows.",
    "Dev Toolbox favors structured concepts like sessions, sprints, and work items over open-ended flexibility. While this reduces customization, it reinforces clarity, traceability, and explainability in day-to-day work.",
    "Choosing a self-hosted architecture increased setup complexity but preserved data ownership, extensibility, and long-term control — priorities that aligned with the project’s goals even at the cost of onboarding friction."
