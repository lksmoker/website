    "role": "Independent designer and developer",
    "timeline": "2022–Present",
    "tags": ["Internal tools", "Developer experience", "Full-stack"],
    "problem": "Traditional developer environments scatter context across multiple tools — IDEs, planners, terminals, logs, GitHub, and documentation — increasing cognitive load and slowing down reasoning.",
    "context": "Built as a deeply personal exploration into what a unified, explainable development environment could look like, especially when working solo across multiple systems and projects.",
    "solution": "Designed and built a mobile-first, self-hosted IDE that integrates code editing, GitHub activity, structured logs, live console output, sprint planning, and project context into a single environment. Everything stays close at hand, reducing switching costs and making system reasoning more natural.",
    "impact": "By bringing development tools and project structure into one coherent workspace, Dev Toolbox improves focus, reduces friction, and makes day-to-day work more structured, explainable, and predictable.",
