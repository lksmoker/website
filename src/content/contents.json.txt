{"meta":{"title":"About","description":"Learn about my background in systems, operations, leadership, and software development — and how those experiences shaped the way I build tools and platforms today."},"sections":{"summary":{"body":"My career has always centered on building systems that help people work with clarity. I’ve led teams, shaped large-scale operations, created workflow automations, and developed internal tools and software platforms — all guided by a calm, adaptive approach to complexity and a strong belief that systems should support people, not the other way around."},"story":["My career began in environments where clarity and structure were essential to keeping daily operations running. In custodial and facilities management roles across multiple university campuses, I supervised large teams, coordinated coverage across high-variance spaces, and maintained productivity levels significantly above industry benchmarks. Over time, I became responsible for the operational systems beneath the work — CMMS workflows, payroll and HR processes, accounts receivable, transportation coordination, and other information flows that kept teams moving. These roles gave me a deep understanding of how performance depends on workflow design, clear expectations, and the systems people rely on every day.","That instinct to strengthen and clarify systems eventually led me toward building tools myself — first through workflow automations and internal reporting scripts, and later through full-stack application development. I’ve since designed budgeting tools, workflow systems, developer environments like Dev Toolbox, and conceptual models for conversational software through Aurora. What looks like a career shift is really a continuation of the same work: understanding how people interact with systems, and creating structures that make that interaction calmer, clearer, and more aligned with real-world needs."],"howIWork":["As I moved from operations into software, I carried the same commitment to clarity and structure. I build in a clarity-first way — starting with briefs, system outlines, and narrative framing before implementation — so the work stays intentional and aligned across the entire project."],"skills":{"systemsAndOperations":"Designing clear workflows and repeatable processes Improving team communication and operational alignment Building structure around complex or variable work Translating real-world constraints into actionable systems","leadershipAndPeople":"Supervising, coaching, and mentoring teams Supporting people through change and ambiguity with empathy and clarity Creating shared understanding in moments where expectations or goals are shifting","softwareAndArchitecture":"Independently building internal tools and full-stack applications Designing developer workflows and structured reasoning systems Automation and integration (Google Apps Script, internal tools) End-to-end development of conceptual platforms (Dev Toolbox, Simplicity)","conceptualAndStrategic":"Systems thinking across operational and technical domains High-level reasoning about software creation, clarity, and explainability Vision development for emerging concepts (Aurora, App Kernel)"},"values":["Clarity — People work best when expectations and systems are simple, honest, and direct.","Calm Structure — Good systems reduce noise, support adaptability, and help people focus on what matters.","Transparency — Understanding should be visible, shared, and built into the work.","Human-Centered Design — Tools should support people, their goals, and the realities of their day-to-day workflow."],"auroraOriginSafe":["Aurora began as a series of questions about clarity, communication, and the gap between how people think and how software expects us to think.","It grew from the idea that software creation could feel more conversational, more explainable, and more aligned with natural human reasoning — without exposing technical internals or implementation details."],"personalNotes":["I enjoy designing systems in any context — work, tools, writing, or personal organization.","I gravitate toward environments where clarity and purpose matter, and where thoughtful design makes work feel lighter for everyone involved."]}}

{"meta":{"title":"Aurora","description":"Aurora is a conceptual approach to building software through conversation."},"sections":{"whatItIs":["Aurora is a conceptual approach to building software through conversation.","It’s centered on the idea that people should be able to express intent in natural language, see clear, inspectable feedback, and guide systems through a shared understanding — a workflow that mirrors the way people naturally think, collaborate, and adapt."],"whyItMatters":["Software creation today is fragmented across documents, tools, and communication channels. People express meaning one way, systems expect something else, and clarity often gets lost in the translation.","Aurora explores a more natural path — one where clarity, reasoning, and understanding are part of the process itself. It’s motivated by a desire to reduce drift, restore alignment between what people mean and what systems do, and make the development experience feel more human and less adversarial."],"origin":["After building several apps with AI assistance, I ran into the same frustrations many others have described: bugs that didn’t make sense, feedback loops that went nowhere, and long chains of fixes that seemed disconnected from what I actually meant. Tools are improving — some models now sit right next to your code — but the process still feels murky and overly complicated.","I noticed a pattern repeating itself: a human speaks to an AI, the AI interprets the human’s intention, and then translates that understanding into Python, JavaScript, HTML, and so on. Each step is another layer where meaning can drift. We’re forcing AI to operate inside architectures that were never designed with AI in mind.","My background in operations and systems design made the gaps especially visible: unclear communication, unclear reasoning, unclear connections between cause and effect. My restorative instincts pushed me toward a simple question — how do we reduce this friction and bring systems back into alignment with human intention?","At the same time, my strengths in empathy and connectedness kept highlighting the human side of the problem: people think conversationally, relationally, iteratively. We clarify through dialogue. We refine meaning together. So why shouldn’t software follow the same pattern?","And that raised a new possibility: what if AI could work in an environment native to its reasoning — one where human intent could translate more directly into behavior, without detouring through multiple disconnected layers?","What if the conversation was the development environment?","As Aurora took shape, I began seeing the same challenges reflected in emerging articles and research, validating my intuition and direction:"],"signals":["@{id=ai-coding-tools-observability; source=ZDNET — \"Why AI coding tools like Cursor and Replit are doomed — and what comes next\"; href=https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-ai-coding-tools-like-cursor-and-replit-are-doomed-and-what-comes-next/; idea=Raises a blunt question: if AI coding tools are just thin wrappers around foundation models, how will they survive — and where will real differentiation come from?; auroraAnswer=Aurora treats observability and understanding as the differentiator.
