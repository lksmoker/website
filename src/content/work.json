    "intro": "This page gives a clearer picture of the systems I’ve shaped or built — from large-scale operational workflows to internal tools, full-stack applications, and conceptual platforms. Before I wrote software, I was redesigning real-world systems: leading teams responsible for hundreds of thousands of square feet, clarifying workflows, stabilizing communication loops, and improving performance in high-variance environments. That same instinct now drives my work in tools, platforms, and conceptual models like Aurora — building systems that bring clarity, structure, and explainability to complex work.",
