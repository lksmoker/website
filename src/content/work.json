    "intro": "This page highlights systems I’ve led, shaped, or built — from large-scale operations and logistics workflows to internal tools, full-stack applications, and conceptual product work. Before I wrote software, I was redesigning real-world systems: leading teams responsible for hundreds of thousands of square feet, clarifying handoffs, stabilizing communication loops, and improving reliability in high-variance environments. That same approach now shows up in software: build the structure, make reasoning visible, close the feedback loop, and design the system so it can change without losing integrity.",
