    "intro": "Most of what I’ve learned about building systems hasn’t come from getting things right the first time. It’s come from noticing where friction kept appearing — and then tracing it backward. Writing is part of how I close that loop. These pieces reflect on moments where execution struggled, clarity broke down, or systems drifted — and what changed once intent, context, and structure moved earlier in the process.",
