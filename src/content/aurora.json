      "Aurora is a conceptual approach to building software through conversation.",
      "It’s centered on the idea that people should be able to express intent in natural language, see clear, inspectable feedback, and guide systems through a shared understanding."
    ],
    "whyItMatters": [
      "Software creation today is fragmented across documents, tools, and communication channels.",
      "Aurora explores a more natural path — one where clarity, reasoning, and understanding are part of the process itself."
    ],
    "origin": [
      "After building several applications with AI at my side, I ran into the same frustrations many developers describe: fragile code, subtle bugs, and long feedback loops that spin without really moving forward.",
      "Even as tools improved — bringing powerful models right into the editor — the process still felt strangely indirect. I would describe what I wanted, the AI would interpret my intent, then translate it into layers of Python, JavaScript, HTML, and configuration scattered across the stack.",
      "That multi-step translation started to feel like the real bottleneck. We were asking AI to squeeze into architectures that were never designed with AI in mind. Aurora is my attempt to ask a different question: what if AI could work in an environment that’s native to its reasoning, where human language can map more directly into software behavior without losing the trail of meaning along the way?"

        "idea": "Raises a blunt question: if AI coding tools are just thin wrappers around foundation models, how will they survive — and where will real differentiation come from?",
        "auroraAnswer": "Aurora treats observability and understanding as the differentiator. Instead of competing on code generation alone, it focuses on making every change explainable: who asked for it, why it exists, and how it fits into the larger system."

        "idea": "Argues that software should be structured so both humans and large language models can read, reason about, and safely extend it.",
        "auroraAnswer": "Aurora takes a complementary approach: instead of reshaping code to be a little more AI-friendly, it imagines a kernel where human intent, system facts, and effects are first-class concepts the AI can work with directly."

        "auroraAnswer": "Aurora’s emphasis on traceability is one answer to this tension: if every AI-proposed change carries a visible rationale and causal trail, teams have a better shot at reviewing, trusting, or rolling back what the system produces."
