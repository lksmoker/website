    "whatItIs": [
      "Aurora is a conceptual approach to building software through conversation.",
      "It\u2019s centered on the idea that people should be able to express intentions clearly, receive understandable feedback, and guide systems through a shared understanding."
    ],
    "whyItMatters": [
      "Software creation today is fragmented across documents, tools, and communication channels.",
      "Aurora explores a more natural path \u2014 one where clarity, reasoning, and understanding are part of the process itself."
    ],
    "origin": [
      "Aurora emerged from years of working in both operational environments and independent software development.",
      "It is an exploration of how clarity and conversation could shape the way we build and refine software."
    ],
    "whatItIsNot": [
      "Not a no-code tool",
      "Not an IDE",
      "Not an assistant",
      "Not a rules engine",
      "Not a schema or protocol",
      "Not a product announcement"
    ],
    "howItWorksSafe": [
      "Aurora uses a conversational workflow: people describe what they want, the system expresses its understanding, and both work together to shape the result.",
      "This is a conceptual framing, without revealing internal structures or technical mechanisms."
    ],
    "futureDirection": [
      "Aurora will evolve gradually, beginning with narrative descriptions and eventually expanding to high-level examples.",
      "Technical details, internals, and system mechanics will remain undisclosed."
    ],
    "cta": "If you\u2019re interested in the ideas behind Aurora, I\u2019m always open to high-level conversations about the concepts and vision."
